-- Custom SQL migration (M04): the public profile and the list view need the city of a person and
-- the name of each lineage, and app_public_ro reads only the three public views (plan §6.2,
-- §6.4). Both views gain columns at the end; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW keeps the existing columns,
-- their order and the grants, so app_public_ro still reads exactly the same three relations.
-- SQL compatible with PostgreSQL 16+ and PostGIS 3.4+ (plan §3.2).

-- 1. v_public_person + city_name: the city of residence or activity at city level only (the
--    name from the GeoNames excerpt, never a point). The privacy notice lists country and city
--    as part of a public profile.
